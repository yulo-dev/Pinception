# Privacy Policy for Pinception

**Effective Date: July 13, 2025**

Pinception is a Chrome extension that allows users to pin and organize ChatGPT messages and personal prompts. The extension is designed to operate entirely within the user's browser and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

## What data do we collect?

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal or identifiable data.

All data such as pinned messages, saved prompts, and tags are stored **locally** using `chrome.storage.local` within your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## Permissions

Pinception requests access to:

- `https://chat.openai.com/*` — to integrate with the ChatGPT interface
- `storage` — to save your pinned messages and personal prompt data locally

These permissions are required only to support the core functionality of the extension.
