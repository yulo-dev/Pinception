# 📌 Pinception – Pin & Reuse Your ChatGPT Messages

**Pinception** is a minimalist Chrome extension that helps you **pin, revisit, and reuse ChatGPT messages and prompts** — right inside the ChatGPT interface.

No more endless scrolling. No more retyping the same prompt. No more losing great answers in long threads.

## 💡 Why Pinception?

ChatGPT is powerful, but it wasn't built for memory. Once a message scrolls out of view — it's basically gone.

Have you ever...

- Asked ChatGPT a long question and only understood the first part — but then lost track of the rest?
- Followed up multiple times, only to realize you want to jump back to an earlier reply?
- Remembered a great answer from last week, but had no idea which thread it was in?
- Found yourself typing the same prompt every day like:
  *"Can you rewrite this in a friendly tone?"* or *"Summarize this in bullets."*

If any of that sounds familiar, **Pinception was made for you**.
